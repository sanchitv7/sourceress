    #   • Install Playwright (`pip install playwright && playwright install chromium`) and
    #     use the async API (`async with async_playwright()`).
    #   • Reuse a logged-in LinkedIn session by passing the `li_at` cookie (google "linkedin li_at scraping").
    #   • Navigate to the LinkedIn People Search results page built from `query` and keep scrolling
    #     until `max_results` profiles have loaded (`page.evaluate("window.scrollBy")`).
    #   • Extract profile card details via locator queries instead of brittle XPath.
    #   • Consider `asyncio.gather` for concurrent profile-page enrichment.
    #   • Respect LinkedIn's TOS ‑ add rate limiting and randomised delays.
